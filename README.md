Element Screenshot
===============

This is a Chrome extension which will take screenshot of any HTML element in a webpage.

Click the camera icon in the URL bar, hover over the element you want to capture and click to take the screenshot.

This extension was originally developed by Robinson and available [here](https://github.com/tlrobinson/element-capture), which is not maintained anymore. My version is a bug fixed version of the original.
